# KNN
Could you clarify what aspect of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) problem you're working on? KNN is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.

Some common topics related to KNN include:

Understanding how KNN works – It classifies data points based on the majority class among the k nearest points.
Choosing the right value for k – How to pick the optimal number of neighbors.
Distance metrics – Common metrics like Euclidean distance.
Implementing KNN – Writing Python code using libraries like scikit-learn or from scratch.
Performance issues – Challenges with scaling, handling large datasets, or high-dimensional data.
